# render.yaml
# This file configures the deployment of the Word Rush application on Render.
# It defines two services: the backend server and the frontend client.

services:
  # Service 1: The Node.js Server (Web Service)
  # This runs the Express and Socket.io backend.
  - type: web
    name: word-rush-server
    runtime: node
    # The root directory of the server code within the monorepo.
    rootDir: packages/server
    # Commands to build the server from TypeScript to JavaScript.
    buildCommand: "npm install && npm run build"
    # Command to start the server after a successful build.
    startCommand: "node dist/index.js"
    # Render's health check will ping this endpoint to ensure the server is live.
    healthCheckPath: /health
    # Plan: Choose "Free" or "Starter" in the Render dashboard.
    # The Free plan may have limitations (e.g., spinning down after inactivity)
    # that can affect real-time connections. The "Starter" plan is recommended
    # for a stable, always-on WebSocket server.
    plan: free
