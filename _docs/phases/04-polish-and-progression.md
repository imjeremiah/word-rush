# Phase 4: Polish and Progression

**Goal**: To elevate the functional game into a highly polished, engaging, and replayable experience. This phase focuses on implementing the "juicy" feedback, the session-based progression system, and other advanced features.

**Scope**: Advanced animations, sound effects, progression mechanics, alternative game modes, and final UI implementation based on `theme-rules.md`.

**Deliverable**: A feature-complete, polished game that feels satisfying to play and provides short-term goals to keep players engaged. The application will be ready for initial user testing.

### Features & Tasks

#### 1. Visual & Audio Polish ("The Juice")

- **Description**: Implement the full suite of satisfying feedback mechanisms outlined in the `ui-rules.md`.
- **Steps**:
  1.  Add fluid animations to tile selections, word submissions, and board cascades.
  2.  Integrate particle effects for successful word submissions to make scoring feel more rewarding.
  3.  Implement a sound system and add sound effects for key game events (e.g., tile selection, valid/invalid word, timer alerts).
  4.  Add subtle screen shake for powerful word scores or board resets.

#### 2. "King of the Hill" Progression System

- **Description**: Implement the session-based progression system to give players a clear, short-term goal.
- **Steps**:
  1.  On the server, when a match ends, award one "Crown" to the winner.
  2.  Track the Crown count for each player for the duration of their session (socket connection).
  3.  In the React UI, display the Crown count next to each player's username in the lobby and in-game.
  4.  Implement the "King of the Hill" visual distinction (e.g., a glowing username or crown icon) for the player with the most Crowns in the session.

#### 3. Advanced Game Modes

- **Description**: Introduce variety into the gameplay by implementing the alternative game modes.
- **Steps**:
  1.  Allow the host to select "Themed Rounds" or "High-Value Letter Mode" in the lobby.
  2.  For "Themed Rounds", the server will need a way to validate words against a specific category word list.
  3.  For "High-Value Letter Mode", adjust the letter generation algorithm on the server to increase the frequency of rare letters.
  4.  Clearly indicate the current game mode in the UI.

#### 4. Final UI and Theme Implementation

- **Description**: Ensure the entire application's UI is polished and consistent with the established theme.
- **Steps**:
  1.  Audit every React component and apply the styles (colors, fonts, spacing, shadows) defined in `theme-rules.md`.
  2.  Ensure all UI elements are fully responsive and work seamlessly on both mobile and desktop screen sizes.
  3.  Implement all iconography using the chosen library (`react-feather`).
  4.  Add smooth transitions and animations to all UI screens (e.g., lobby appearing, settings menu sliding in).

#### 5. Final Touches and Stability

- **Description**: Address edge cases and stability issues to prepare the game for deployment.
- **Steps**:
  1.  Implement graceful handling for player disconnections and reconnections, allowing a player to rejoin a match in progress.
  2.  Create a simple client-side settings panel for toggling sound effects and music volume.
  3.  Conduct thorough testing across different browsers to identify and fix any remaining bugs.
  4.  Prepare the application for deployment on Render, including creating the `render.yaml` file.

#### 6. Performance Validation & Final Documentation

- **Description**: Ensure the project meets all technical and documentation requirements from the project brief.
- **Steps**:
  1.  Create and run a stress test script to validate that the server can handle 50 concurrent users with latency under 150ms.
  2.  Verify that the client maintains 60 FPS during the stress test.
  3.  Complete the `brainlift.md` with a final summary of the development process.
  4.  Create the final demo video and other supporting documentation required by the brief.
