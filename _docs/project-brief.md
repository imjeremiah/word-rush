# Game Project Guide

## Core Challenge

You will develop a multiplayer game using technologies you have never worked with before. This project tests your ability to:
- Research and learn new technologies rapidly using AI
- Make informed technical decisions under time constraints
- Build production-quality software in unfamiliar territory
- Demonstrate that AI-augmented developers can match or exceed traditional development timelines

## Technical Requirements

### Game Specifications
- **Multiplayer Support**: Real-time interaction between multiple players
- **Performance**: Low latency, high performance gameplay with no lag
- **Platform**: Your choice - mobile, web, or desktop application
- **Complexity**: Must include levels or character progression - players need a sense of advancement
- **Engagement**: Fun, interesting gameplay with clear objectives or storyline

### Development Pathways

Choose one of these pathways based on your target platform. Each pathway has been selected for having excellent documentation, active communities, and AI-friendly learning resources:

#### Path 1: Desktop Game Development with Godot
- **Engine**: Godot
- **Language**: GDScript (Python-like syntax)
- **Networking**: Godot's built-in multiplayer API
- **Why this path**: Godot has exceptional documentation, thousands of tutorials, and GDScript is designed to be beginner-friendly. The engine handles many complex tasks for you while still teaching core game development concepts.

#### Path 2: Browser-Based Game
- **Framework**: Phaser 3 (2D) or Three.js (3D)
- **Language**: JavaScript
- **Networking**: Socket.io for real-time multiplayer
- **Why this path**: Both frameworks have extensive documentation. Phaser 3 is perfect for 2D games with built-in physics and animations. Three.js opens up 3D possibilities if you want an extra challenge. Socket.io simplifies multiplayer implementation.

#### Path 3: Unity for Cross-Platform
- **Engine**: Unity
- **Language**: C#
- **Networking**: Unity Netcode for GameObjects or Mirror Networking
- **Platform**: Desktop or WebGL build
- **Why this path**: Unity has the largest game development community, countless tutorials, and comprehensive documentation. C# is well-structured and extensively covered by AI training data.
