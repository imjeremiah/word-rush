# Word Rush Development Log (Brainlift)

## Overview

This document serves as a comprehensive log of the AI-augmented development process for Word Rush, documenting key decisions, learning experiences, and technical implementation details.

## Project Goals

- Develop a multiplayer word game using technologies I've never worked with before
- Demonstrate AI-augmented development capabilities
- Build production-quality software under time constraints
- Create an engaging, polished, and replayable gaming experience

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Current)

### Date: Initial Setup

**Objective**: Establish the core project structure and development environment

#### Key Decisions Made:

1. **Monorepo Architecture**: Chose npm workspaces to manage client, server, and common packages
   - **Rationale**: Facilitates code sharing, dependency management, and development workflow
   - **Implementation**: Created packages/client, packages/server, packages/common structure

2. **Technology Stack Implementation**:
   - **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite for fast development and hot reloading
   - **Game Engine**: Phaser 3 for 2D game rendering and animation
   - **Backend**: Express.js + Socket.io for real-time multiplayer functionality
   - **Development**: ESLint + Prettier for code quality and consistency

3. **Hybrid UI Architecture**:
   - **React Components**: Handle application shell, menus, and static UI elements
   - **Phaser Canvas**: Manages game board, animations, and real-time gameplay
   - **Integration Strategy**: Seamless visual integration between React and Phaser

#### Technical Achievements:

- ✅ Monorepo structure with proper TypeScript configuration
- ✅ Express server with Socket.io integration and basic security measures
- ✅ React client with Vite development server and proxy configuration
- ✅ Phaser 3 integration with React lifecycle management
- ✅ Shared type definitions for client-server communication
- ✅ ESLint and Prettier configuration for the entire monorepo

#### Challenges Encountered:

1. **TypeScript Configuration Complexity**: Setting up proper TypeScript references between packages
   - **Solution**: Used composite projects and proper extends configuration
   - **Learning**: Monorepo TypeScript setups require careful dependency management

2. **Phaser-React Integration**: Ensuring proper cleanup of Phaser game instances
   - **Solution**: Used useEffect cleanup functions and proper ref management
   - **Learning**: Game engine lifecycle management is crucial for preventing memory leaks

#### Next Steps:

- Install dependencies and verify the development environment
- Test client-server communication
- Implement basic game mechanics
- Add security measures and error handling

### Update: Board Size Change to Official Scrabble Dimensions

**Date**: Current Update

**Objective**: Update the game board to use official Scrabble dimensions (13x13) instead of the initial 4x4 placeholder.

#### Changes Made:

1. **Constants Update**: Modified `DEFAULT_GAME_CONFIG` in `packages/common/src/constants.ts` to use 13x13 dimensions
2. **Phaser Game Board**: Updated `PhaserGame.tsx` to render a 13x13 grid with smaller tiles (40px) to fit the larger board
3. **Visual Adjustments**: 
   - Increased canvas size from 800x600 to 1000x800 to accommodate the larger board
   - Reduced tile size from 60px to 40px and font size from 24px to 16px
   - Adjusted positioning and spacing for better visual layout
4. **Code Quality**: Fixed ESLint warning in server error handler

#### Technical Details:

- **Board Dimensions**: Now uses `DEFAULT_GAME_CONFIG.boardWidth` and `DEFAULT_GAME_CONFIG.boardHeight` (13x13)
- **Tile Size**: Reduced to 40px with 2px spacing between tiles
- **Layout**: Grid positioned at (50, 100) with proper centering
- **Letter Display**: Cycles through alphabet to fill all 169 tiles

#### Visual Improvements:

- Maintained hover effects for tile interaction
- Updated title to reflect "13x13 Scrabble Board"
- Adjusted instruction text positioning for larger canvas
- Preserved responsive scaling behavior

### Phase 1 Security & Infrastructure Completion

**Date**: Phase 1 Final Implementation

**Objective**: Complete all missing Phase 1 requirements including security, error handling, and word validation infrastructure.

#### Major Achievements:

1. **Official Tournament Word List Integration**:
   - Successfully acquired and integrated TWL06 (Tournament Word List 2006) with 178,691 words
   - Implemented `DictionaryService` with O(1) lookup performance using Set data structure
   - Added server-side word validation with proper error handling
   - Word list loaded into memory on server startup for fast validation

2. **Socket.io Rate Limiting & Security**:
   - Implemented `SocketRateLimiter` service to prevent abuse (30 requests/minute per client)
   - Added rate limiting for all socket events with graceful degradation
   - Automatic cleanup of expired rate limit entries to prevent memory leaks
   - Configurable rate limits with retry-after messaging

3. **Comprehensive Error Handling**:
   - Created `withErrorHandling` wrapper for all socket event handlers
   - Added global try-catch protection for all socket operations
   - Implemented typed error events with error codes for better debugging
   - Server-side error logging with timestamps and client identification

4. **Client-Side Notification System**:
   - Built `NotificationService` with toast notifications for all server events
   - Supports error, warning, info, and success notification types
   - Auto-dismissing notifications with configurable duration
   - Click-to-dismiss functionality with smooth animations
   - Proper cleanup and memory management

5. **Enhanced Type Safety**:
   - Expanded `ServerToClientEvents` and `ClientToServerEvents` interfaces
   - Added comprehensive game state types (`GameError`, `PlayerSession`, `WordValidationResult`)
   - Full type safety for all client-server communication
   - Imported and properly organized shared types

6. **Real-time Word Validation**:
   - Implemented bidirectional communication for word testing
   - Server validates words against official tournament dictionary
   - Client receives instant feedback with success/error notifications
   - Point calculation based on word length (placeholder for full Scrabble scoring)

#### Technical Implementation Details:

- **Dictionary Loading**: 1.7MB tournament word list loaded in ~50ms on server startup
- **Performance**: O(1) word lookup using JavaScript Set for 178,691 words
- **Security**: Rate limiting prevents >30 requests/minute per client
- **Error Handling**: All socket events wrapped with comprehensive error handling
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage for all client-server communication

#### Testing & Validation:

- Added interactive word validation test interface in client
- Server health endpoint shows dictionary status and word count
- Real-time notifications for connection, errors, and rate limiting
- Comprehensive error logging for debugging and monitoring

## Development Insights

### AI-Augmented Development Process:

1. **Research Phase**: Used AI to understand unfamiliar technologies (Phaser 3, Socket.io)
2. **Architecture Planning**: Leveraged AI for best practices in monorepo setup
3. **Code Generation**: AI assistance in boilerplate creation and configuration
4. **Problem Solving**: Real-time debugging and optimization suggestions

### Technology Learning Curve:

- **Phaser 3**: Moderate complexity, good documentation, straightforward React integration
- **Socket.io**: Well-documented, TypeScript support excellent
