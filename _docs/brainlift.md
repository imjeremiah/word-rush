# Brainlift: AI-Augmented Development Log

This document tracks our learning process, key decisions, and AI interactions throughout the Word Rush project.

## Session 1: Project Scoping & Gap Analysis
**Date**: 2024-07-16
**Goal**: Solidify project requirements and implementation strategy.

### Key Insights & Decisions:
- Decided on in-memory session management tied to socket IDs for simplicity.
- Established initial performance targets: <150ms latency for word validation, and a baseline of 50 concurrent users per server instance.
- Agreed on a straightforward "generate-then-validate" board generation algorithm to ensure quality.
- Outlined simple, effective strategies for security, error handling, and core game mechanics.
- Confirmed that the initial target is a responsive browser application, not a native mobile app.

### AI Prompts & Interactions:
- **Prompt**: "deeply review the abnove docs. does the overview full yimplement and caputre the ideas and requiremnts of the brief?..."
- **AI Response Summary**: The AI performed a comprehensive gap analysis, identifying missing details in AI learning documentation, performance specs, security, error handling, and several core game logic implementations.
- **Action Taken**: Used the AI's gap analysis to form a concrete, simple, and straightforward implementation plan for all identified gaps. We are now updating the project documentation to reflect this solidified plan before beginning development.
