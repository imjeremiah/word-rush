2. **Technology Stack Implementation**:
   - **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite for fast development and hot reloading
   - **Game Engine**: Phaser 3 for 2D game rendering and animation
   - **Backend**: Express.js + Socket.io for real-time multiplayer functionality
   - **Development**: ESLint + Prettier for code quality and consistency

3. **Hybrid UI Architecture**:
   - **React Components**: Handle application shell, menus, and static UI elements
   - **Phaser Canvas**: Manages game board, animations, and real-time gameplay
   - **Integration Strategy**: Seamless visual integration between React and Phaser

#### Technical Achievements:

- Add security measures and error handling

### Update: Board Size Change to Official Scrabble Dimensions

**Date**: Current Update

**Objective**: Update the game board to use official Scrabble dimensions (13x13) instead of the initial 4x4 placeholder.

#### Changes Made:

1. **Constants Update**: Modified `DEFAULT_GAME_CONFIG` in `packages/common/src/constants.ts` to use 13x13 dimensions
2. **Phaser Game Board**: Updated `PhaserGame.tsx` to render a 13x13 grid with smaller tiles (40px) to fit the larger board
3. **Visual Adjustments**: 
   - Increased canvas size from 800x600 to 1000x800 to accommodate the larger board
   - Reduced tile size from 60px to 40px and font size from 24px to 16px
   - Adjusted positioning and spacing for better visual layout
4. **Code Quality**: Fixed ESLint warning in server error handler

#### Technical Details:

- **Board Dimensions**: Now uses `DEFAULT_GAME_CONFIG.boardWidth` and `DEFAULT_GAME_CONFIG.boardHeight` (13x13)
- **Tile Size**: Reduced to 40px with 2px spacing between tiles
- **Layout**: Grid positioned at (50, 100) with proper centering

### Major Architectural Achievements:

#### 1. **Advanced Path Validation System**:
- Enhanced server-side word submission with sophisticated tile path validation
- **Adjacency Checking**: Validates consecutive tiles are adjacent (including diagonals)
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Ensures no tile position can be reused within a single word path
- **Path Rules**: Enforces minimum 2-letter words with proper path traversal
- **Error Messaging**: Provides specific feedback for invalid path types

#### 2. **Event System Redesign**:
- **Split Validation Events**: Replaced unified `word:validation-result` with separate `word:valid` and `word:invalid` events
- **Improved Payloads**: `word:valid` includes word, points, and total score; `word:invalid` includes word and specific reason
- **Type Safety**: Updated common types and client handlers for new event structure
- **Better UX**: Separate success/failure handling improves user feedback clarity

#### 3. **Board Generation Algorithm Enhancement**:
- **Refined Solver**: Improved `findWordsFromPosition` with configurable minimum word length (3 letters)
- **Path Rules Integration**: Board validation now uses same path rules as client validation
- **Performance Optimization**: Added 20-character limit to prevent infinite recursion
- **Better Documentation**: Comprehensive JSDoc with algorithm explanation and parameter details

#### 4. **Complete Component Architecture Refactor**:
- **React Context Integration**: Created `GameContext` for centralized state management
- **Component Extraction**: Split monolithic App.tsx into specialized components:

```typescript
// Enhanced validation with adjacency and uniqueness checks
function validateTilePath(tiles: LetterTile[]): ValidationResult {
  // 1. Minimum length validation
  // 2. Duplicate position detection using Set
  // 3. Adjacency validation for consecutive tiles
  // 4. Diagonal support (8-directional movement)
}
```

#### Event System Improvements:
- **Before**: Single `word:validation-result` with complex payload
